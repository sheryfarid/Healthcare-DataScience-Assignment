## Scenario: 

You are working as a data scientist for a healthcare analytics company. You have been 
provided with a dataset containing anonymized patient data. Your task is to clean the data, 
visualize it, analyze statistical relationships, and simulate a basic health-related system 
using First Order ODEs. 

Q1: Outlier Detection and Feature Reduction (2 Marks) 
- Use VarianceThreshold to remove constant features (if any).
- Detect and remove outliers from CholesterolLevel using any method of choice.
- Replace any missing values. 

Q2: Data Visualization (2 Marks) 
- Generate a box plot comparing BloodPressure between different RiskCategory levels. 
- Create a count plot showing the number of patients in each RiskCategory per Region. 

Q3: Statistical Hypothesis Testing (3 Marks) 

Perform the following: 
- Is the average CholesterolLevel significantly different from 200 mg/dL having a sample 
size of 20? 
- Is there a significant relationship between Region and RiskCategory? 
Include:
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Test statistic, p-value
- Your interpretation (reject/fail to reject Hâ‚€) 

Q4: Modeling a Health System with ODE (3 Marks) 

Model the progression of a patient's medication in the bloodstream. 
Equation: 
dC/dt = k(D - C) 

Where: 
- k = 0.1, D = 100, C(0) = 0 
- Solve this ODE for t = 0 to 50 using both odeint and solve_ivp 
- Plot the result and explain the difference in output between the two solvers, if any.
